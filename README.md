Creates a chart of concepts for a systematic review, or other literature search.

Systematic review strategies can be difficult to read and process. For ease of communication, use a chart to display the main concepts of your systematic review.

What are the concepts? These are the main searchable topics of your systematic review.
If you are familiar with PICO, it is an attempt to separate out the concepts from a question.
If your systematic review is on a medical topic, the disease or disorder will probably be one of the concepts. E.g. Myocardial Infarction
Concepts are often represented by MeSH. Different concepts are usually combined using the Boolean operator AND.

When you enter your strategy, remember these tips:

-Fields with an asterisk* are required, all others are optional.
-If you have more than one alternative strategy for your concept, enter them separated by semi-colons. (e.g. Concept: Dietary Supplements, Alternative Strategies: Vitamins; Minerals; Probiotics)
-Likewise, if you have more than one limit, please enter them separated by semicolons.
-If you enter any Boolean operators (e.g. NOT), please enter them in all capitals.

What is an alternative strategy? When you have a concept that can't be represented by just one MeSH term or keyword.
Examples:
Concept: Patient Satisfaction Alternative Strategy: Quality of Life
Concept: Leadership Training Alternative Strategy: Leadership AND Training
Concept: Dietary Supplements Alternative Strategy: Vitamins; Minerals; Probiotics

Alternative Strategies can be useful to show synonyms, previous indexings which are being used to find older articles, and differences in available subject headings in various databases.
Alternative Strategies would usually be combined with tbe main concept in your search using the Boolean operator OR.
